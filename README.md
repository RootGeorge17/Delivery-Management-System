# ParcelBuddy

Developed a Delivery Management System for the logging and tracking of parcel deliveries and deliverers for a small delivery company.
• Structured the codebase using the MVC design pattern and OOP principles, facilitating enhanced scalability and robust maintainable code.
• Utilized the Singleton design pattern to ensure a singular accessible Database instance for resource management optimization across the application.
• Implemented a routing system to manage incoming HTTP requests, offering user-friendly URLs and enhancing application flexibility as it expands.
• Integrated user authentication, allowing secure login, logout and encrypted password storage, ensuring data privacy.
• Integrated a middleware system to manage user authorization, ensuring secure access control to various pages and functionalities based on user roles.
• Ensured data integrity by implementing input validation and robust exception handling throughout the application.
• Implemented search functionalities, pagination and filtering for efficient and user-friendly retrieval of delivery records in a large dataset.
• Provided manager users with CRUD functionalities to manage parcel entries and assign deliveries to specific delivery users.
• Designed and tested the system's ability to handle significant data volumes (1000s parcel records, 1000s of delivery users) to ensure performance.
• Implemented security measures to prevent SQL injection attacks, ensuring robust data security across the application.
